# Take Home Interview Project

### To Run

1. navigate to project folder satalite-downtime-webtool (accidently named it that)
2. run 'npm i' to install node_modules
3. run 'npm start' to start the application

#### Bugs

1. You can pick any two dates but need to pick a future end date if you want to pick a future start date and the reverse for past
2. If the downtime is on the same day but valid times you can still make the downtime, but the start date box will go red for error
3. Can create a downtime without start and end dates (its a feature)

#### Example
