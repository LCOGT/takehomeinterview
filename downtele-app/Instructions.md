Hello Thank you for taking the time to view my project :)
---
### Please have the latest versions of these installed:
- Node.JS
- npm

1. Download project and enter the directory through the terminal. Be sure to be within the `downtele-app` folder.
2. run `npm update` on the terminal. then `npm install` to install all required dependencies.
3. Finally, run `npm start` to run the program. A Web browser should show up. (if not please open one and go to localhost:3000 )
4. Lastly the webpage should show up. you can now click on `Add New Record` to place your first downtime.
- Note you cannot start and end at the same time (this was done purposefully)
- you may switch your computer to Night or Day mode the page will automatically change color scheme.
