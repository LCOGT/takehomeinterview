Using XAMPP for the PHP interpreter. 

Currently, the database file location and php file for viewing planet details
is hard coded to be in the same folder called planetwebsite.

As of May 28, 2018, the project is mostly done, still working out how to get the hyperlinks to link to the related 
planet every time rather than linking to the last planet added to the HTML table. 

Will be able to continue working on it next weekend.
