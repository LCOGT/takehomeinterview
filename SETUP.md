# PlanetDB, an iOS app!

Hi folks,  
I'm primarily a back-end algorithm engineer, but I've been playing around with making iOS apps lately so I thought I'd make an app for this challenge. It should fit all of the criteria for valid planet entries, including checking for valid inputs and not allowing duplicate names and ordinalities. It also stores and saves the database as long as you continue using the same virtual device (e.g. If you create planets on a virtual iPhone 7, then close the program, then run again on the iPhone 7, the data will persist. If you close, then run using an iPhone 6, then it will start anew with a blank database. Just think of the different virtual devices as being different actual phones that you loaded the app onto).  

The app is based off of a tutorial I did while learning iOS app development using Swift, the repo for that is here:

Despite the similarities, this was a lot more complicated due to the custom criteria of the challenge. I learned a lot while developing this.  

To load the app, just clone the project onto a Mac with the latest version of XCode (version 8.3.2), then open the PlanetDB.xcodeproj file, then run the project by clicking the "play" button on the top-left or by pressing "âŒ˜-R". I recommend testing on the virtual iPhone 7, although it should work well on all the phone devices while in profile view. I did not test on iPad devices. Using it should be pretty self-explanitory once you have it up and running.  

Please feel free to ask any questions, and feedback is always welcome. Enjoy!
