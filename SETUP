Since the job posting mentioned you use Django, I thought that even though I have never used it before, that now would be the perfect time to try it out. I had a Debian 9 VM with Python 3.5 already installed which I used for this. 

The code is in rvs_planets. I saw that Django has their own Forms but thought that might be too much to learn for now so I just used some basic HTML. 

Thanks for taking a look.
