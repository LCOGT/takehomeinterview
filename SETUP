PLANET DATABASE INSTRUCTIONS
LCO Interview Take-Home Project

April 2017

OVERVIEW
This software defines a web server allowing a user to see and add to a database of planet data. It is written entirely in Javascript using the Node.js framework.

FILE MANIFEST
- server.js: serves a web interface to a database of planets to which a user can add.
- boilerplate.html: contains markup for the non-changing part of the database home page and is used by server.js.
- SETUP: this instruction file.
- planet_db.txt will be generated by server.js on its first run. It is a local file used as a database by server.js and is persistent across runs.

HOW TO RUN
- This web application was created for the Node.js framework. Instructions for installing Node.js are at https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node.
- The above files should all be in one folder.
- From within the folder containing the above files, run 'node server.js' at a terminal prompt. It should start a server on local (127.0.0.1) port 8080.
- Using a web browser (Chrome preferred), navigate to local port 8080. The home page should load and be ready for use.
- To clear the database, delete the file planet_db.txt and restart server.js.

RELATED WORKS
In previous projects I have also written in Java and Javascript to visually present space-related data. One, drawing on exoplanet data from the Kepler Space Telescope, shows animated planetary systems in comparison to Earth's orbit around the sun. Another presents multiple viewpoints on a computer graphics simulation of the Earth-sun-moon system as a tool for demonstrating basic orbital phenomena such as eclipses. I look forward to demonstrating these projects for you soon.
