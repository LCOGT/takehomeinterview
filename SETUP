This is a Django project in a docker container for easy deployment.

These instruction assumes you have a docker server running on your machine. (docker can be downloaded from https://www.docker.com/community-edition ).

With the docker server up and running:

1. docker-compose build
2. docker-compose run web python manage.py migrate
3. docker-compose up

Now, point your browser to localhost:8000 and you're all set.


If you wish to access the Django admin facility, you must first create an admin username and password.
Here's the command to do this within the docker container:

  docker-compose run web python manage.py createsuperuser


You can shutdown the service with:

docker-compose down
