OVERVIEW
This software defines a web server allowing a user to see and add to a database of planet data. It is a simple example with minimal use of external libraries and is written entirely in Javascript for simplicity.

FILE MANIFEST
- server.js: serves a web interface to a database of planets to which a user can add.
- boilerplate.html: contains markup for the non-changing part of the database home page and is used by server.js.
- planet_db.txt: is a local file used as a database by server.js.
- SETUP: this instruction file.

HOW TO RUN
- This web application was created for the Node.js framework. Instructions for installing Node.js are at https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node.
- The above files should all be in one folder.
- planet_db.txt should exist but be completely empty before the first run. In subsequent runs new planets are appended to it.
- From within the folder containing the above files, run 'node server.js' at a terminal prompt. It should start a server on local (127.0.0.1) port 8080.
- Using a web browser (Chrome preferred), navigate to local port 8080. The home page should load and be ready for use.
- To clear the database, delete the contents of planet_db.txt so that it is empty (but do not delete the file itself).
